### [Advent of Code 2015](https://adventofcode.com/2015)

The first step on the quest to completion.

Attemping to write fairly neat and tested code, and trying to do things in a
functional style (but not always succeeding).

Run `sbt test` to run the tests, after installing
[sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/).

Currently this repo also contains some generic implementations of useful data
structures and problem solutions, but eventually they'll get moved out into a
shared repo.
