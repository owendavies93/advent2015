### [Advent of Code 2015](https://adventofcode.com/2015)

The first step on the quest to completion.

Attemping to write fairly neat and tested code, and trying to do things in a
functional style (but not always succeeding).

Run `sbt test` to run the tests, after installing
[sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/).

#### TODO

- [x] Move util modules into shared repo
- [ ] Re-implement Day 22 using Djikstra (or some other non random trial method)
- [ ] Ditto for Day 21 (although probably just DFS)
- [ ] Add tests for Day 22
- [ ] Add tests for all parts of all days
- [ ] Reduce use of mutable data structures across all days
- [ ] Rewrite some days in a more functional and less impeartive style
